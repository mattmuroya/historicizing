            The control which designers know in the print medium, and often desire in the web medium, is simply a function of the limitation of the printed page. We should embrace the fact that the web doesn’t have the same constraints, and design for this flexibility. But first, we must “accept the ebb and flow of things.”

            <h2>overview</h2>

            <p>The internet has become a critical component in modern culture. Since the inception of the internet, it has increasingly been used as a tool for global commerce and the worldwide dispersal of information. In the digital information age, there is no combination of tools so empowering as curiosity, determination, and access to the internet.</p>

            <p>We are on the cusp of a digital breakthrough; and it fits in your back pocket. Mobile phones are becoming a staple of human society. People previously disconnected at home—no computer, no means of internet access—are adopting mobile devices at an astounding rate; more than 90% of Americans have a mobile phone, and even in developing nations like Kenya and Nigeria two-thirds of people have mobile phones. What’s more, mobile web adoption is growing at 8 times the rate of early web technologies in the 90s.</p>

            <p>Haas' main statement is that: there is a divided concept of technology in the workplace, there are many different forms of technologies in effect in the workplace, and "advanced" technologies are not necessarily the most powerful ones. Haas draws on the ideas of contingency and constraint from Bijker's theory of sociotechnical change to understand the both constant and changing nature of technology as it related to different societal viewpoints.</p>
