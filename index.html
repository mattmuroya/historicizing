            <!--
            <p>“Hey! I saw this really great article on this website—you should go look it up!”</p>

            <p>Just about a decade ago, a statement like this would have meant one thing: you tell a friend to go look something up on the web, and they (Yes, I’m using “they” as a singular, gender-neutral pronoun. If it was good enough for Shakespeare, it’s good enough for me!) go home to look it up on their desktop or laptop computer. Though there certainly may have been some variation in exact screen dimensions, everyone’s window into the internet looked pretty much the same: an approximately 16x9 aspect ratio (or, becomingly less common, 4x3) with width and height somewhere around 1400 and 800 pixels respectively. This was the standard, and web content was written and designed with the desktop in mind. Occasionally you’d get higher resolution monitors, but these generally didn’t change your browsing experience other than to afford you more screen space for more on-screen applications.</p>

            <p>Fast-forward to today.</p>

            <p>“Go look it up” could mean a myriad of things. Sure, it could mean going home, firing up your desktop, and opening up browser. But it could also mean flipping open your laptop which might range anywhere from a little 10-inch netbook to a 17-inch gaming powerhouse. It could mean reaching into your backpack and pulling out your tablet, which might be a compact nexus 7 or iPad mini; a full-sized iPad; or even a new monster 12-inch iPad pro.</p>

            <p>But today, the first thing people will reach for is much, much smaller than any of those. It’s the technological wonder that fits in your back pocket: your smartphone.</p>

            <p>There are a lot of smartphones out there. In fact, more than 90% of Americans own a cell phone; and of those, nearly two-thirds use their phones to access the internet http://www.pewinternet.org/2013/09/19/cell-phone-activities-2013/. That’s a lot of internet-ready pocket devices. There are hundreds and hundreds of different devices that people are using to access the internet. Screen sizes, dimensions, and ratios are unpredictable. And therein lies the problem: no longer can web designers be sure that their websites and content are going to look like they do on their computers; users are coming to the web from unpredictable angles and with unpredictable windows.</p>

            <p>In print, the designer is God. Print designers have full control over the layout and presentation of their page; they can be 100% certain that they way they see their printed designs is the way the reader will see it as well. This might be considered an advantage of print <em>or</em> a severe limitation. In the early days of the web, designers wanted to be sure that their sites were being seen as designed. The web tried to emulate the printed page in every aspect; layout and design alike.</p>

            <p>I attend the University of Minnesota where I am privileged to have studied under several prestigious instructors, among whom is Professor Christina Haas; a well-established and respected scholar in the field of rhetorical theory, writing and technology. Her work grounded in Vygotskian theory and articulated through Bijkerian concepts on the relationships between old and new technologies and the transformative integration of computer tools in writing is foundational to the discipline, and I intend to build from her writings <em>On the Relationship Between Old and New Technologies</em> (1999) and <em>Writing Technology: Studies on the Materiality of Literacy</em> (1996) a theoretical framework by which to examine the historical progression of web publishing, responsive design, and CSS media queries.</p>

            <h2>media queries</h2>
            <p>IN PROG</p>
            <p>The response to this shift in the web design community has been a recent development termed Responsive Web Design (RWD); the implementation of new front-end web technologies designed to accommodate the non-standardized grab bag selection of devices out there. RWD throws pixel-perfect design and control out the window in favor of adaptable, fluid web content that fits whatever screen it graces. Many different technologies have gone into the practice, but heart of RWD is a technology called a media query.</p>

            <p>Media queries are a CSS rule officially included in CSS3. They are a way for the designer to structure content and web pages to "ask" browsers certain details when they are fetched, particularly the size of the screen and/or browser window. They are used to conditionally load rules (primarily certain CSS rules; sometimes entire files) based on the return of these items. This way, a way a page and its content is displayed is optimized to the device.</p>

            <h2>the rhetorical reframe</h2>

            <p>In 1999, Christina Haas wrote <em>On the Relationship Between Old and New Technologies</em>
                <a href="#fn:1"></a> as an argument for the complication of our understanding of the relationship between these “old” and “new” technologies; in it she argues that the commonly referenced linear model of the progression of technology oversimplifies a complex system in which old and new technologies coexist and influence one another in nuanced ways in response to human and cultural influences. She augments a previous publication, <em>Writing Technology: Studies on the Materiality of Literacy</em> (1996), in which she makes the claim that "Computer writing systems, like all writing tools, work one way and not another because of institutional history and politics, underlying theories of technology and writing, and human decision making within a social context" (140). Her discussion is sprung from Vygotsky's notion of <strong>technological mediation</strong> which affirms that changing technologies are not simply a linear progression of tools; but that they change with individual and cultural social practices as well as explicit human design decisions.</p>

            <p>To examine writing and literacy, Haas also employs Vygosky's <strong>historical-genetic method</strong>—a method of contextual examination that injects some phenomenon into its unique historical context to provide deeper understanding of its evolution—and expands its application to include technology. Haas explores this idea more thoroughly, drawing upon several concepts from Bijker's theory of sociotechnical change
                <a href="#fn:2"></a> to understand both the constant and changing natures of technology as they relate to societal influence. One of these Bijkerian concepts, and the one I will be using to address media queries in particular, is that of <strong>contingency and constraint</strong>.

                <h3>contingency and constraint</h3>

                <blockquote>"...decisions about technology are always partial and contingent—there might have been (and there may yet be) another choice. Yet, decisions about technology, whether in development or in use, are not boundless: they are constrained by the historical, material, and cultural circumstances surrounding them" (Haas).</blockquote>

                <p><strong>Contingency</strong>, according to Bijker, is the idea that change is <em>dependent</em> on external factors; that is, human design decisions, whether arbitrarily or intentionally, alter the course of technological change. <strong>Constraint</strong> is the idea that change is <em>limited</em> by external factors as well; material, cultural, and social bounds impose restrictions upon technological change. Haas gives the example of the QWERTY keyboard, a recognized constant in computer-based technology. QWERTY was a contingent human design decision, one of many possible text input methods for computers. For reasons beyond the scope of this study, QWERTY became the standard. Now, QWERTY remains the standard for computer input; so strong a conceptual model and embodied "frame of reference" constrain it to cultural, societal, and historic artifacts.</p>

                <p>Computer technologies (and writing technologies in general) are, by nature, material conventions and therefore are the product of social constructs and human design decisions. To understand computers as writing tools and their designs, we must see them as tools with histories; that is, they are built upon layers of other writing technologies (alphabets, writing and logic systems, even the physical manifestations of writing) and they are the product of conscious human design decisions (Haas 139). This follows the Vygotskian assertion that tools and technologies are not created, but rather culturally and socially "appropriated" (138) and evolved.</p>

                <p>These premises, I think, set us up with a proper framework within which to examine change as it relates to responsive web design and CSS media queries. What are the "predecessors" of web design, and how did they influence the development of media queries? What social and cultural constructs were (and are) surrounding the discussion of media queries and responsive web design? What issues of socioetechnical change did the development of media queries embody, and what contentions did it address and/or stir? In the following sections I hope to reframe modern repsonsive web design and the development of media queries as components of changing social practices; contingent upon human design desisions, and moulded by practical constraints.</p>

            <blockquote>"What I sense is a real tension between the web as we know it, and the web as it would be. It’s the tension between an existing medium, the printed page, and its child, the web. And it’s time to really understand the relationship between the parent and the child, and to let the child go its own way in the world." –John Allsopp</blockquote>

            <p>CSS media queries, now denoted by an <code>@media</code> rule in our stylesheets, have a winding history in this course of sociotechnical change. The idea first came about in 1994 with the initial proposal for CSS stylesheets. It was considered and contested for nearly two decades before its implementation with CSS3 in 2012.
                <p>

                    <p><a href="http://www.w3.org/People/howcome/p/cascade.html">Håkon W Lie | Cascading HTML style sheets—a proposal</a></p>

                    <p>One of the very first documents that proposed the idea of cascading style sheets, this proposal written by Håkon W Lie of Opera was actually quite heavily skewed toward the idea that would one day become "media queries," although the proposal doesn't use this term; Lie says that these style sheets should be able to "provide logic to make presentation decisions based on the user's environment; e.g. the size of the screen or the current date." This document laid out the idea of CSS styles: writing rules in such a way that the publisher has some leverage over his content's presentation; but where the user still has some sense of control. It is a direct response to a growing issue; Lie explains early in the proposal that the lack of control of presentation had been a "source of much frustration among professions that are used to be in control of paper-based publishing."</p>

                    <p>Though much of the proposal is unspecific to the idea of media queries or responsive content presentation, he says in a section titled "Limitations" that "there should be a way of adding and subtracting style sheets from within the document." This is a very tangible concern that Lie recognized: not all styles written by the designer would optimally suit all screens or users. The limitations of print no longer applied, and Lie sought to break such constraints with what would become the foundation of responsive design.</p>

                    <p><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-CSS2/media.html">W3C | Media Type Dependencies: CSS2 Specification, 12 May 1998</a></p>

                    <p>CSS2 introduced media-specific stylesheets that allowed for the selective loading of cascading styles based on the <strong>media type</strong> of the receiving device; this meant that stylse could be altered according to how content was being displayed: "on the screen, on paper, with a speech synthesizer, with a braille device, etc."</p>

                    <blockquote>"CSS2 supports media-specific style sheets so that authors may tailor the presentation of their documents to visual browsers, aural devices, printers, braille devices, handheld devices, etc."</blockquote>

                    <p>The <code>@media</code> rule used to denote this media type-dependent loading was used as follows:</p>
                    <blockquote>
                        <code>
                        @media print {<br>
                        <span class="indent">BODY { font-size: 10pt }</span><br>
                        }<br><br>
                        
                        @media screen {<br>
                        <span class="indent">BODY { font-size: 12pt }</span><br>
                        }<br><br>
                        
                        @media screen, print {<br>
                        <span class="indent">BODY { line-height: 1.2 }</span><br>
                        }
                </code>
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>The inclusion of media types and media-dependent styles indeed addressed the differeny types of devices that would be used to display content, but Lie wasn't satisfied. Developers had no tools to limit the scope of styles within a particular type, and therefore media types did not solve the problem of adding and subtracting specific styles from documents. Along with Tantek Çelik of Microsoft, Lie set out officially recommend <strong>media queries</strong> as we know them today.</p>

                    <p><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/CR-css3-mediaqueries-20020708/">Håkon W Lie | Media Queries: W3C Candidate Recommendation, 8 July 2002</a></p>

                    <p>Lie began a <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/WD-css3-mediaqueries-20010404/">working draft</a> of his proposal in 2001, and officially submitted it in July of 2002. He says of his proposal:</p>
                    <blockquote>HTML4 and CSS2 currently support media-dependent style sheets tailored for different media types. For example, a document may use sans-serif fonts when displayed on a screen and serif fonts when printed. "Screen" and "print" are two of media types that have been defined. Media Queries extend the functionality of media types by allowing more precise labeling of style sheets.
                        <br>
                        <br>A Media Query consists of a media type and one or more expressions to limit the scope of style sheets. Among the media features that can be used in media queries are "width", "height", and "color". By using Media Queries, presentations can be tailored to a specific range of output devices without changing the content itself.</blockquote>

                    <p>Media queries would determine a device's <em>capabilities</em>, rather than just its type. Device and browser width, heigh, aspect ratio, and color/monochrome displays could all be considered in restricting or augumenting certain styles to optimize static, reusable HTML content.</p>

                    <p>Lie's proposals became a point of contention and subject of some critical eyes.</p>

-->

                    <p> From the get-go, Lie recognized the problem posed by the new (though limited at the time) advent of mobile web browsers:</p>

                    <blockquote>"The introduction of mobile web devices with smaller screens poses a presentation problem. The two-dimensional table-based layout of a common web page does not scale well onto a smaller screen. Using Media Queries, the style sheet can use a table-based layout on a large screen, and a block-based layout on a small screen. The content will be the same, but a few lines in the style sheet will be different, and the right one will automatically be selected."</blockquote>

<!--
                    <p>Shortly after Lie's recommendation was published, Art Barstow of the W3C sent <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2002Jul/0082.html">an email message</a> to Lie questioning his proposal in the shadow of <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/WD-CCPP-struct-vocab-20010315/">another working draft W3C proposal</a>, CC/PP (Composite Capabilities/Preference Profiles), server-side technology that addressed similar issues of device uncertainty. Barstow also inquired about device-specific documents, citing the "important design principle" of device independence. Lie replied:</p>

                    <blockquote>"...the work on Media Queries is continued from HTML4 where section 6.13 sketches a solution [1] very close to Media Queries. So, the "solution" was developed before the work on CC/PP started and should not be interpreted as hostile to CC/PP... Media queries encourages *documents* to remain device independent, while the *style sheet* is not. This way, the style sheets shield documents and encourage content reuse."</blockquote>
-->

                    <p>Shortly after Lie's recommendation was published, email messages from George Lund and Lachlan Cannon regarding the practicality and real-world implementation of media queries. Skeptical of the value of media queries in the presence of JavaScript and media types that addressed similar issues, they were critial of a new recommendation. Lend even acknowledged "...authors'... (misguided) attempts at pixel-perfect control in CSS" and said that media queries wouldn't solve the issue of the designers' desire for control.</p>
                    <p>Lie simply reiterated his commitment to reusable, device-independent HTML content:</p>

                    <blockquote>"In general, I believe a declarative solution is better than an imperative solution.... I see the horrors of 'dynamic HTML' on the web everyday and don't want to condemn authors into [JavaScript] for wanting to reuse content on many devices."</blockquote>

                    <p>After wrestling with contingency, constraints, and a good deal of contention, the official recommendation was published in 2012. In 2007, the W3C deemed media queries operable and implementable, and after five years, they were included with CSS3.</p>

            <h2>putting it all together</h2>
            
            <p>Using Vygotsky's historical-genetic method of examination, we can map the development of media queries and—consequently—responsive design as a whole onto Haas' expansion of the Bijkerian concepts of contingency and constraint. Lie recognized the importance of device-independent HTML, and developed the idea of media-specific style sheets as a way to afford designers the control afforded to them in the print medium while also addressing the issue of device uncertainty and the rising of mobile web browsers.</p> 

            <p>We have to see the web and website design as "the product of social constructs and human design decisions" (Haas), and media queries are an explicit example of such. The Lie proposal for CSS all the way back in 1994 illustrates some of the tangible concerns in web design and publishing, noting the need to be able to adjust to the user, and for the publisher/writer to be able to leverage the capabilities of the web in such a way that he has some semblance of control. Lie's statment "I believe a declarative solution is better than an imperative solution" embodies the idea that technological change is not a linear progression of tools, but that it is contingent upon human design decisions and the social and cultural context of the time.</p>

            <p>There are many different browsers and models of mobile devices out there; the writer can no longer design for a standardized set of screens. Media queries and responsive design are a response to the changing landscape of devices to address issues of accessibility and new demographics; they are implemented because writers and designers now realize that while the web may have evolved from print, there are certain characteristics that are no longer impose constraints or limitations. They are an evolution. The web can live side by side with print, as old and new technologies must do.</p>
            
            <p>But the mediational means by which users are interacting with and shaping the web are changing, and our practices of web design and implementation of tools like media queries are necessary components to sociotechnical change.</p>
